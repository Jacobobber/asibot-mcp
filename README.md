# Asibot

Asibot gives Claude direct access to 26 enterprise platforms your team already uses — from Microsoft 365 and Salesforce to GitHub and Jira — so employees can search, read, create, and act across all of them in a single conversation, with per-user authentication and encrypted credentials.

## Get Started

Your Claude Enterprise admin configures the Asibot MCP integration once — after that, it's available to every employee across Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and claude.ai automatically. No per-user setup needed.

The first time you use Asibot, tell Claude:

> **Set up my Asibot account.**

Claude walks you through Microsoft SSO sign-in. After that, just talk:

> **Connect me to Jira.**

> **Search SharePoint for the Q4 budget deck.**

---

## What You Can Do

**Work across platforms without switching tabs.** Ask Claude to pull context from multiple tools in one conversation — find a Jira ticket, check the related GitHub PR, look up the customer in Salesforce, and draft a summary email in Outlook.

**Read and write everywhere.** Search SharePoint files, read email threads, create Jira issues, update Salesforce records, send Teams messages, add Notion pages, run Zapier actions — 150+ operations across 26 services.

**Stay in control.** Every connection is per-user with individual credentials. Set services to read-only or read-write. Disconnect anytime. Admins control who can access what.

## Security & Privacy

**Your credentials, your access.** Asibot acts on your behalf using your own credentials. It cannot access anything you can't already access in each service. If you can't see a SharePoint file in your browser, Claude can't see it through Asibot either.

**Credentials are encrypted and isolated.** Each user's service credentials are stored separately, encrypted at rest with Fernet symmetric encryption. No one — not admins, not other employees — can access your stored tokens. Admins can see usage metrics (which services you used, how often) but never credential contents.

**Read-only by default.** Every service connection starts in read-only mode. Write access (creating issues, sending emails, updating records) must be explicitly enabled per service by the user.

**Audit trail.** Every tool call is logged — who called what, when, which service, success/failure. Admins can review usage patterns and detect anomalies.

**SSO-only authentication.** No passwords are stored or managed by Asibot. User identity comes from Microsoft SSO, and admin roles sync from Azure AD security groups.

## Connecting Services

Tell Claude **"Connect me to [service]"** and it walks you through the rest. What happens next depends on the service:

**Microsoft 365** (SharePoint, Outlook, Teams, Calendar) — Already connected after your initial SSO sign-in. Nothing extra needed.

**GitHub, Google Workspace** — Claude shows a sign-in link and a short code. Open the link, enter the code, authorize. Done in 30 seconds. (Requires your admin to have configured the OAuth app — see admin setup below.)

**Everything else** (Jira, Confluence, Salesforce, Notion, Zendesk, HubSpot, Figma, etc.) — Claude asks you for a personal API token. You generate one in that service's settings and paste it into the conversation. Claude stores it encrypted and never shows it again.

### Other commands

- **"What services am I connected to?"** — see all active connections
- **"Disconnect Salesforce"** — remove stored credentials
- **"Set GitHub to read-only"** — control access levels per service
- **"Rotate my API key"** — generate a new key, old one stops immediately

## FAQ

**What can Asibot see?**
Only what you can already access. Asibot uses your personal credentials for each service — it has exactly the same permissions you do.

**Who can see my credentials?**
No one. Credentials are encrypted per-user and never exposed — not to admins, not in logs, not to other employees.

**What if SSO sign-in fails?**
Make sure you're signing in with your company Microsoft account (not a personal one). If the device code expires, tell Claude "Set up my Asibot account" again to get a fresh code. Contact IT if your account is blocked from the Asibot app registration.

**Can I use Asibot on my phone?**
Yes, through claude.ai on mobile. The MCP integration works anywhere Claude does — Desktop, Code, and web.

**What happens if I leave the company?**
Your Asibot account and stored credentials are tied to your Microsoft identity. When your Azure AD account is disabled, your API key stops working and your encrypted credentials become inaccessible.

**Can I connect to a service Asibot doesn't support?**
Not directly, but you can use the Zapier connector to reach 6,000+ apps through Zapier actions.

**Is my data sent to Anthropic?**
Asibot runs on your company's own Azure infrastructure. Data from your SaaS tools flows from the service API → your Asibot server → Claude. Anthropic's standard data handling policies for your Claude Enterprise plan apply to the conversation content.

## Server Deployment (Azure)

This section is for admins deploying the Asibot server on an Azure Linux VM.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure Linux VM (Standard D4as v5 recommended for 1000+ users)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on the VM
- A Microsoft Entra ID app registration
- TLS certificates (or use Azure Application Gateway for termination)

### 1. Azure AD App Registration

1. **Azure Portal → Entra ID → App registrations → New registration**
2. Name: `Asibot`, account type: **Single tenant**
3. **Authentication → Advanced settings** → enable **Allow public client flows**
4. **API permissions** → add **Microsoft Graph** delegated permissions:
   - `User.Read`, `GroupMember.Read.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All`, `Mail.Read`, `Calendars.Read`, `Team.ReadBasic.All`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `Chat.Read`, `Notes.Read.All`, `Tasks.Read`, `offline_access`
5. **Grant admin consent** for all permissions
6. Note your **Tenant ID** and **Application (client) ID**

### 2. Admin Role Sync (Optional)

Automatically assign admin roles from Azure AD group membership:

1. Create a security group in Azure AD (e.g., "Asibot Admins")
2. Add the employees who should be admins
3. Set `ASIBOT_ADMIN_GROUP_ID` to the group's **Object ID**

When users sign in, the server checks group membership and assigns `admin` or `user` role automatically.

### 3. Configure and Deploy

Docker Compose handles everything — PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, Redis, Nginx, Prometheus, and Asibot itself. The database schema is created automatically on first start. You just set a few environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values, then:
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Required `.env` settings:**

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-password          # Used by PostgreSQL and Asibot
ASIBOT_MS365_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id           # From step 1
ASIBOT_MS365_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id           # From step 1
```

That's it for a working deployment. Everything else has sensible defaults. The compose stack brings up PostgreSQL 16, PgBouncer (connection pooling), Redis (distributed cache), Nginx (TLS + rate limiting), Prometheus, and AlertManager automatically.

**Recommended additions:**

```env
ASIBOT_ADMIN_GROUP_ID=your-security-group-id    # Azure AD role sync (step 2)
ASIBOT_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN=your-secret         # Secure the metrics endpoint
ASIBOT_SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL=yourcompany.sharepoint.com
```

### Connector Setup by Auth Type

Services connect in three ways. Microsoft 365 is handled by the required Entra ID app (step 1). The rest are optional — configure what your org uses.

#### OAuth device code flow (admin configures once, users just sign in)

| Service | Admin sets in `.env` | User experience |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **GitHub** | `ASIBOT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | User says "connect to GitHub," gets a sign-in link + code, authorizes in browser |
| **Google Workspace** | `ASIBOT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `ASIBOT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same — sign-in link + code for Google account |

To get these credentials:
- **GitHub**: Create an OAuth App at github.com → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps. Set the callback URL to `https://github.com/login/device`. Copy the Client ID.
- **Google**: Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Enable the Calendar and Drive APIs.

#### Personal API tokens (no admin setup, users bring their own)

These services don't require any admin configuration. Users generate a token in the service's settings and paste it when Claude asks.

| Service | Where users get their token |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Jira / Confluence** | atlassian.com → Account Settings → Security → API tokens |
| **Salesforce** | Setup → My Personal Information → Reset My Security Token |
| **Notion** | notion.so → Settings → Connections → Create integration |
| **Zendesk** | Admin Center → Apps and integrations → APIs → Zendesk API |
| **HubSpot** | Settings → Integrations → Private Apps → Create |
| **Figma** | Account Settings → Personal access tokens |
| **Smartsheet** | Account → Personal Settings → API Access |
| **Adobe Sign** | Account → Adobe Sign API → Access Tokens |
| **Zoom** | Zoom Marketplace → Server-to-Server OAuth app (Account ID, Client ID, Client Secret) |
| **Paylocity** | Paylocity admin → API credentials (Client ID, Client Secret, Company ID) |
| **Others** | Claude tells the user exactly what to provide when they connect |

#### Business defaults (optional, reduces user friction)

Pre-fill org-level settings so users don't have to provide them:

```env
ASIBOT_GITHUB_ORG=mycompany
ASIBOT_ATLASSIAN_DOMAIN=mycompany.atlassian.net
ASIBOT_ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN=mycompany
ASIBOT_SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL=https://mycompany.my.salesforce.com
ASIBOT_SHAREPOINT_SITE_URL=yourcompany.sharepoint.com
```

**TLS:** Place certificates at `deploy/certs/cert.pem` and `deploy/certs/key.pem`, or set `TLS_CERT_PATH`/`TLS_KEY_PATH` in `.env`. Alternatively, terminate TLS at Azure Application Gateway and set `ASIBOT_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=true`.

**High availability** (adds PostgreSQL streaming replication):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ha.yml up --build -d
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
curl https://your-server/health
```

### Key Design Choices

**Authentication** — Microsoft SSO via device code flow. Users sign in once in the browser, the server polls for a token, creates an API key (`asb_...`), and returns a config snippet for Claude Desktop. Subsequent requests use the API key in the `Authorization` header, resolved to a user via a 3-level lookup: in-memory LRU cache (10K sessions) → PostgreSQL → API key table.

**Credential isolation** — Every user's credentials are stored separately, encrypted at rest with Fernet symmetric encryption. The master key lives at `~/.asibot/master.key` with 600 permissions. Optional external KMS (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) for production.

**Role sync** — During SSO setup, the server calls Microsoft Graph `/me/memberOf` to check Azure AD group membership. Members of a configured security group get `admin`; everyone else gets `user`. Roles update automatically on re-setup.

**Rate limiting (3 layers)** — Global per-service sliding window (200 req/min default, configurable per service), per-user limits (30 req/min), and Nginx rate limiting (30 req/s per IP, 2 req/min for setup endpoint).

**Circuit breaker** — Per-service circuit breakers prevent cascade failures. 5 failures → circuit opens → fast-fail for 60 seconds → half-open probe → close on success. All state tracked in Prometheus gauges.

**Connection pooling** — Shared `httpx.AsyncClient` pool (200 clients, LRU eviction) avoids TCP/TLS connection churn. PgBouncer (transaction mode, 200 max connections) pools database connections. Both designed for 1000+ concurrent users.

**Caching** — Three layers: Redis distributed cache for S2S OAuth tokens and rate limit counters, in-memory session store (10K LRU cap), and HTTP connection pool. Falls back gracefully — Redis unavailable → in-memory, no data loss.

**Observability** — Prometheus metrics (request latency histograms, error counters, circuit state gauges, session cache hit rates), AlertManager rules (error rate, circuit open, auth spikes, latency).

**Concurrency** — asyncio event loop with semaphore-based limiting at three levels: 2000 global, 10 per-user, 200 per-service. Background tasks for cleanup (sessions, tokens, rate limits, audit pruning) run on 60-300 second intervals with error isolation.
